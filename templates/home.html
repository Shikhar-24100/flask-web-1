    <p class = "lead">
      Jovian, often referred to as "Jupiter-like," pertains to characteristics resembling those of Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system. This term typically describes gas giants, massive planets composed predominantly of hydrogen and helium, lacking a solid surface. Jovian planets, including Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, boast extensive atmospheres, strong magnetic fields, and numerous moons. Their dynamic weather systems, with features like Jupiterâ€™s Great Red Spot, exemplify the complexity and grandeur of these celestial giants.
